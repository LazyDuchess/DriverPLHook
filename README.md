# DriverPLScripting
A basic, experimental C++ interface for modding Driver Parallel Lines

Uses the [Universal D3D Hooking Library by ImCytox at UnknownCheats](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/direct3d/335041-universal-d3d-hooking-library.html), included in D3DHook folder.

Requires the legacy DirectX SDK (June 2010) for building the project yourself.
